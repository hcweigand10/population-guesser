# Geoquizzer

Geoquizzer is population guessing game built with React/Typescript. We built this game for fun, and are proud to have created something that friends can play for bragging rights or casual users can play to explore the world. 

## Inspiration

In the age of WHF, daily games like wordle captivated millions, and provided a brief yet consistent and routine challenge. The simplicity and popularity of games like these always impressed us, but our favourite example is [Worldle](worldle.teuteuf.fr). This game, (along with our hopefully) can appeal to both geography buffs and people who can't tell north from south on a map. But ours also rewards knowledge beyond memorized map boundaries; world health metrics, geographical features, and regional population distribution all play into the number of inhabitants a country holds. 

## Tech Used

- React
- Typescript
- React Query
- UseContext hook
- Globe.js
- NinjaAPI's country API
